Writing Modern China (in English)

Description
Over the course of the twentieth century, China underwent enormous changes in the sweep of modernization, which opened the door to a wealth of experimentation, especially in literature and culture. The primary focus of this course is to explore how literary forms adapted to the dominant political and cultural movements of modern China. At the same time, individual Chinese writers crafted unique visions from their experiences "on the ground." In works that date from the late Qing to the present, we will explore the varied representations of Chinese modernity, including topics, such as the individual and society, revolution and tradition, the countryside and the city, gender and sexuality. No prior knowledge of Chinese literature or Chinese language is required.

Korean American Literature and Culture
Credit Hours

Description
What is Korean American Literature and what is the justification for setting it apart from the rest of Asian American literature? The course approaches this question by taking up a range of fictional and dramatic writings, almost all of which were turned out between 1995 and 2012. Many writings not on the syllabus will also be introduced, in order to convey a broader picture. Films on Korean Americans help us look beyond literature per se to a wider cultural perspective. As the semester evolves we will continue to keep an eye on the range of styles, issues, and silences that characterize this field. We will also consider how Korean American literature relates to other literary traditions, such as modern Korean literature and Asian American literature. Finally, we will take up the problem of language: the ways in which English is used to evoke a specifically Korean American idiom and the contrary process through which certain Korean American works reach beyond the â€œethnicâ€? designation and into the mainstream. By the end of the semester we will have assembled some tools for deciding whether a piece of literature qualifies as â€œKorean American.â€?

Women in Love: Portraits of Female Desire in Italian Culture

Description
This course is dedicated to the representation of female desire in Italian culture. From Dante's Francesca da Rimini to Pasolini's Medea, passing through renowned literary characters such as Goldoni's Mirandolina, Manzoni's Gertrude, and Verdi's Violetta, the course will explore different and contrasting voices of female desire: unrequited and fulfilled, passionate and spiritual, maternal and destructive, domestic and transgressive. In particular, the varied and beautiful voices of women in love will become privileged viewpoints to understand the changes that occur in Italian culture in the conception of desire and other intimate emotions, as well as in the notion of gender and sexuality. Students will read texts by men and women from a wide variety of literary genres and artistic forms including not only prose and poetry, but also theatre, opera, and cinema. They will also read important theoretical essays on the conception of love in Western cultures by Barthes, de Rougemont, Giddens, and Nussbaum.

American literature contains an astonishing myriad of voices and forms. This changing topics course introduces students to highlights and countercurrents of the American tradition.
  Topic for 2013-14: A Woman of Independent Means : As with all cultural productions, literary works do not simply reflect reality; they also help to create it. In this course we will read nineteenth- and twentieth-century American literature that endeavors to imagine â€œa life beyondâ€? traditional social roles for American women. Can a woman write herself (or be written) beyond the confines of slavery, the limitations of the â€œmarriage plot," or the expectations of her cultural inheritance? How has the image of the independent woman in fiction evolved from The Coquette to The Woman Warrior? We will read well-known authors such as Henry James, Emily Dickinson, and Toni Morrison in addition to less canonical writers such as Susan Warner and Hannah Webster Foster. Assignments will include quizzes, a midterm, a final, and a few short response essays.

Griffith to Wong Kar-Wai : The focus of this course will be a series of films that take as their theme the disruptive tensionsÃ‘between the sexes and between generationsÃ‘that emerge with shattering force in seemingly ordinary domestic settings. After briefly considering the pictorial roots of this tradition in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century painting, the class will turn to films directed by D.W. Griffith, G.W. Pabst, Marcel Ophuls, Douglas Sirk, Todd Haynes, and Wong Kar-Wai. The class will explore the extensive critical and theoretical literature that is devoted to these films; at the same time we will pay scrupulous attention to their visual qualities through the close analysis of mise-en-scene, lighting, camera-work, and editing.

Television
Credit Hours

Television today is omnipresent and, it sometimes seems, omnipotent: seen by millions worldwide, generating massive revenue, enormously influential in shaping conceptions of ourselves and our world. The course will begin with a study of the specific form of television, and of the development of televisual style (and spectatorial perception) since the invention of the medium. We will consider how television sells not just consumer goods but cultural myths and self-images: of family, class, and national identity; gender roles, sexuality, and lifestyle; and race and ethnicity. We will explore the ways in which industrial and regulatory practices operate behind the scenes to shape and control what and who gets broadcast, and how. The course will conclude with a look ahead to television's next frontiers.

A Nation in Therapy
Credit Hours

Description
What is therapy? Although historically tied to the values and goals of medicine, the roles that therapy and therapeutic culture play in defining life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are now ubiquitous. The impact of therapeutic culture on every major social institution, including the family, education, and the law, has created a steady stream of controversy about the ways in which Americans in particular make judgements about right and wrong, about others, and about themselves. Are Americans obsessed with their well being? Is there a type of humor specific to therapeutic culture? This course provides a broad survey of the triumph of the therapeutic and the insights into the character and culture that triumph reveals.

Description
This is a course about race concepts and human biological variation, viewed from historical and biological perspectives. This course thus has two intertwined emphases. One is placed on the historical connection between science and sociopolitical ideologies and policies. The other is on the evolutionary origin of human biological and cultural diversity. Through lecture and discussion section, topics explored include the role of polygenism, historically and in current scientific thought; biological determinism and scientific racism; the Holocaust and other examples of applied biology and the role of the race concept in current scientific debates, such as those over the place of the Neanderthals in human evolution, as well as those over the book The Bell Curve. The course seeks to guide students through a critical exercise in studying the evolutionary origins of contemporary human biological variation and its close relationship with scientific and popular concepts of race.

Understanding and Improving Schools

Can schools remedy inequalities, or do they reflect and (re)produce them? Drawing from work in educational anthropology, sociology, history, and critical theory, we ask what schools are meant to produce and how this production functions in the everyday life of schooling. We first examine the proposition that schools can be oppressive spaces, and then consider how communities have organized their own struggles to demand and define humanizing and liberatory education. We ask what the purpose of education should be.

Through the Transatlantic Mirror: French-American Encounters from the Age of Revolution to the Age of Disney
Credit Hours
1
Description
France and the United States have fascinated each other throughout their history, beginning with the founding of the American republic. Americans from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries viewed France, and Paris in particular, as a beacon of art, culture, literature, and philosophy. For some, especially African Americans, Paris offered a refuge from discrimination back home. Although the French initially perceived the United States as a rustic backwater, by the dawn of the twentieth century it had emerged as a symbol of the future and as the vehicle of a worldwide mass culture epitomized by Hollywood, Coca-Cola, McDonalds, and Disney. This course traces the evolving relationship between France and the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Drawing on a variety of historical and literary documents, among them novels and essays as well as films, we will investigate the ways in which each country served as a mirror for the other's culture and experience.

When Women Rode Horses: The Tang Dynasty, China's Golden Age (in English)
Credit Hours

Description
The Tang Dynasty has long been considered a high point of Chinese civilization. Travelers from lands as distant as India and Rome brought everything from exotic objects to new dances and new religious ideas, making foreign influence stronger than in any period until the modern era. The Dynasty was also a period of transition in which modes of literature, thought, and government that would dominate for the next thousand years first emerged. In this class, we will examine the literary and intellectual culture of Tang Dynasty China, exploring such topics as the capital city as an urban space and a nexus of Chinese and foreign cultures; intellectual trends inspired by Buddhism and a reevaluation of Confucian ideas; and representations of the Dynasty in later periods.

A multicultural journey through the turbulent waters of medieval and early modern Russia, from the Viking incursions of the ninth century and the entrance of the East Slavs into the splendid and mighty Byzantine world, to the Mongol overlordship of Russia, the rise of Moscow, and the legendary reign of Ivan the Terrible. We move eastward as the Muscovite state conquers the immense reaches of Siberia by the end of the turbulent seventeenth century, when the young and restless Tsar Peter the Great travels to Western Europe to change Russia forever. We will focus on khans, princes, tsars, nobles, peasants and monks; social norms and gender roles; icons and church architecture; and a host of Russian saints and sinners.

Description
Humans have been called rational animals since antiquity, but the notion that we should also develop our non-rational capacities senses, imaginations, memories, and emotionsÃ¢â‚¬â€?is equally central to Western intellectual and cultural history. We will trace this notion through the visual and material culture of early modern Europe in some of its most fascinating manifestations: memory palaces, Jesuit meditation techniques, emblem books, cabinets of curiosities, history paintings, pictorial encyclopedias, games, and more. Each week will involve hands-on study of jewels from Wellesley's own library and museum collections, and each student will finish the semester by writing a history of an object of her choice.

This seminar critically examines the use of prehistory and antiquity for the construction of accounts of national origins, historical claims to specific territories, or the biased assessment of specific peoples. The course begins with an examination of the phenomenon of nationalism and the historically recent emergence of contemporary nation-states. It then proceeds comparatively, selectively examining politically motivated appropriations of the remote past that either were popular earlier in this century or have ongoing relevance for some of the ethnic conflicts raging throughout the world today. The course will attempt to develop criteria for distinguishing credible and acceptable reconstructions of the past from those that are unbelievable and/or dangerous.

In this course, we will examine a broad set of philosophical questions raised by art. What is art? How do we know what it means (if it does mean anything)? What is beauty? What does it mean to have an aesthetic experience, and what grants an object or activity aesthetic value? What is the relationship between aesthetics and ethics? In exploring these general questions we will consider topics such as taste, horror, mimesis, creativity, forgery, public art, and popular art. We will take into account diverse art forms, including, but not limited to, painting, photography, sculpture, literature, music, film, and dance. We will also consider the place of the aesthetic in nature and everyday experience.

Logic studies the principles of valid, or correct, reasoning. It does this by looking for ways to regiment the relationship between a conclusion and the claims that support it. In this course, we will learn how to translate sentences of English into a symbolic language that brings out their logically relevant properties, and we will study formal methods, methods sensitive only to the form of the arguments, as opposed to their content, that allow us to determine whether the conclusions of arguments follow from their premises. We will conclude by reflecting on the formal system itself. How powerful is it? What are its limitations? and on the relationship between logic and ordinary language.

Ethical Theories

Description
We all have feelings and opinions about what kinds of behavior are morally right or morally wrong. But how do we develop those intuitions into a coherent and plausible theory that can withstand criticism and be applied consistently across a range of cases? This course will be an examination of historical and contemporary approaches to systematic ethical theorizing. In the course of our inquiry, we will consider such questions as: Are the effects of your actions all that matter morally? Or does what you intend to do matter too? Is there a significant difference between what you intend to do and the consequences you can reasonably foresee? Is there a moral difference between causing harm and allowing someone to be harmed?

Recent earthquake and tsunami events dramatically highlight the vulnerability of human populations and infrastructure to seismic hazards. Only a thorough understanding of the frequency and magnitude of such events will enable local communities to prepare for future disasters. The rapidly evolving field of paleoseismology tries to answer such questions as: Where do earthquakes occur? How large might they be? How frequent are they? In this seminar-style class we will discuss literature to examine primary and secondary earthquake-induced deformation in various geologic archives and under different stress regimes. Through exercises and research projects students will learn techniques to assess the seismic hazard and to prepare threatened communities.

Environmental Limits and Conservation with Laboratory
Credit Hours

Description
The growing use of global resources challenges our ability to conserve resources themselves, as well as species, ecosystems, and environmental quality. This brings up fundamental questions regarding limits to the sustainability of human and natural systems. This course investigates these far-reaching concepts by examining topics such as fundamentals and implications of thermodynamics, energy and material flow through human and natural systems, conservation of resources and biodiversity, and natural resource management. We will also explore the role of science and technology in surmounting previous limits (e.g. energy consumption and agricultural yields), as well as the implications of inherent limits that may never be broken. Laboratory work will focus on quantitative skills and tools used to assess the sustainability of different systems.

Number theory is the study of the most basic mathematical objects: the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.).

The patterns and structures that emerge from studying the properties of numbers are so elegant, complex, and important that number theory has been called "the Queen of Mathematics." Once studied only for its intrinsic beauty, number theory has practical applications in cryptography and computer science. Topics include the Euclidean algorithm, modular arithmetic, Fermat's and Euler's Theorems, public-key cryptography, quadratic reciprocity. MATH 223 has a focus on learning to understand and write mathematical proofs; it can serve as valuable preparation for MATH 305.

Description
This course is about the mathematics of uncertainty, where we use the ideas of probability to describe patterns in chance phenomena. Probability is the basis of statistics and game theory, and is immensely useful in many fields including business, social and physical sciences, and medicine. The first part of the course focuses on probability theory (random variables, conditional probability, probability distributions), using integration and infinite series. The second part discusses topics from statistics (sampling, estimation, confidence interval, hypothesis testing). Applications are taken from areas such as medical diagnosis, quality control, gambling, political polls, and others.
