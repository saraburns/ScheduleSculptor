A Nation in Therapy
Credit Hours
1
Description
What is therapy? Although historically tied to the values and goals of medicine, the roles that therapy and therapeutic culture play in defining life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are now ubiquitous. The impact of therapeutic culture on every major social institution, including the family, education, and the law, has created a steady stream of controversy about the ways in which Americans in particular make judgements about right and wrong, about others, and about themselves. Are Americans obsessed with their well being? Is there a type of humor specific to therapeutic culture? This course provides a broad survey of the triumph of the therapeutic and the insights into the character and culture that triumph reveals.

Title
Race and Human Variation
Credit Hours
1
Description
This is a course about race concepts and human biological variation, viewed from historical and biological perspectives. This course thus has two intertwined emphases. One is placed on the historical connection between science and sociopolitical ideologies and policies. The other is on the evolutionary origin of human biological and cultural diversity. Through lecture and discussion section, topics explored include the role of polygenism, historically and in current scientific thought; biological determinism and scientific racism; the Holocaust and other examples of “applied biology”; and the role of the race concept in current scientific debates, such as those over the place of the Neanderthals in human evolution, as well as those over the book The Bell Curve. The course seeks to guide students through a critical exercise in studying the evolutionary origins of contemporary human biological variation and its close relationship with scientific and popular concepts of race.

Understanding and Improving Schools
Credit Hours
1
Description
Can schools remedy inequalities, or do they reflect and (re)produce them? Drawing from work in educational anthropology, sociology, history, and critical theory, we ask what schools are meant to produce and how this production functions in the everyday life of schooling. We first examine the proposition that schools can be oppressive spaces, and then consider how communities have organized their own struggles to demand and define humanizing and liberatory education. We ask—always—what the purpose of education should be.

Title
Through the Transatlantic Mirror: French-American Encounters from the Age of Revolution to the Age of Disney
Credit Hours
1
Description
France and the United States have fascinated each other throughout their history, beginning with the founding of the American republic. Americans from the nineteenth to the mid-twentieth centuries viewed France, and Paris in particular, as a beacon of art, culture, literature, and philosophy. For some, especially African Americans, Paris offered a refuge from discrimination back home. Although the French initially perceived the United States as a rustic backwater, by the dawn of the twentieth century it had emerged as a symbol of the future and as the vehicle of a worldwide mass culture epitomized by Hollywood, Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, and Disney. This course traces the evolving relationship between France and the United States in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Drawing on a variety of historical and literary documents, among them novels and essays as well as films, we will investigate the ways in which each country served as a mirror for the other's culture and experience.

	When Women Rode Horses: The Tang Dynasty, China's Golden Age (in English)
	Credit Hours
	1
	Description
	The Tang Dynasty has long been considered a high point of Chinese civilization. Travelers from lands as distant as India and Rome brought everything from exotic objects to new dances and new religious ideas, making foreign influence stronger than in any period until the modern era. The Dynasty was also a period of transition in which modes of literature, thought, and government that would dominate for the next thousand years first emerged. In this class, we will examine the literary and intellectual culture of Tang Dynasty China, exploring such topics as the capital city as an urban space and a nexus of Chinese and foreign cultures; intellectual trends inspired by Buddhism and a reevaluation of Confucian ideas; and representations of the Dynasty in later periods.

	Description
	Humans have been called rational animals since antiquity, but the notion that we should also develop our non-rational capacities—senses, imaginations, memories, and emotions—is equally central to Western intellectual and cultural history. We will trace this notion through the visual and material culture of early modern Europe in some of its most fascinating manifestations: memory palaces, Jesuit meditation techniques, emblem books, cabinets of curiosities, history paintings, pictorial encyclopedias, games, and more. Each week will involve hands-on study of jewels from Wellesley's own library and museum collections, and each student will finish the semester by writing a history of an object of her choice.

	This seminar critically examines the use of prehistory and antiquity for the construction of accounts of national origins, historical claims to specific territories, or the biased assessment of specific peoples. The course begins with an examination of the phenomenon of nationalism and the historically recent emergence of contemporary nation-states. It then proceeds comparatively, selectively examining politically motivated appropriations of the remote past that either were popular earlier in this century or have ongoing relevance for some of the ethnic conflicts raging throughout the world today. The course will attempt to develop criteria for distinguishing credible and acceptable reconstructions of the past from those that are unbelievable and/or dangerous.

	In this course, we will examine a broad set of philosophical questions raised by art. What is art? How do we know what it means (if it does mean anything)? What is beauty? What does it mean to have an aesthetic experience, and what grants an object or activity aesthetic value? What is the relationship between aesthetics and ethics? In exploring these general questions we will consider topics such as taste, horror, mimesis, creativity, forgery, public art, and popular art. We will take into account diverse art forms, including, but not limited to, painting, photography, sculpture, literature, music, film, and dance. We will also consider the place of the aesthetic in nature and everyday experience.

In this course, we will learn how to translate sentences of English into a symbolic language that brings out their logically relevant properties, and we will study formal methods—methods sensitive only to the form of the arguments, as opposed to their content—that allow us to determine whether the conclusions of arguments follow from their premises. We will conclude by reflecting on the formal system itself—How powerful is it? What are its limitations?—and on the relationship between logic and ordinary language.

	An examination of the uses and types of imagination in both childhood and adulthood.

	Ethical Theories
	Credit Hours
	1
	Description
	We all have feelings and opinions about what kinds of behavior are morally right or morally wrong. But how do we develop those intuitions into a coherent and plausible theory that can withstand criticism and be applied consistently across a range of cases? This course will be an examination of historical and contemporary approaches to systematic ethical theorizing. In the course of our inquiry, we will consider such questions as: Are the effects of your actions all that matter morally? Or does what you intend to do matter too? Is there a significant difference between what you intend to do and the consequences you can reasonably foresee? Is there a moral difference between causing harm and allowing someone to be harmed?

	An examination of the nature and functioning of power in politics, with an emphasis on the following questions: What is the nature of power and how has it been exercised in political life, both past and present?
