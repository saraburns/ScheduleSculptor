Writing Modern China (in English)
Credit Hours

Description
Over the course of the twentieth century, China underwent enormous changes in the sweep of modernization, which opened the door to a wealth of experimentation, especially in literature and culture. The primary focus of this course is to explore how literary forms adapted to the dominant political and cultural movements of modern China. At the same time, individual Chinese writers crafted unique visions from their experiences "on the ground." In works that date from the late Qing to the present, we will explore the varied representations of Chinese modernity, including topics, such as the individual and society, revolution and tradition, the countryside and the city, gender and sexuality. No prior knowledge of Chinese literature or Chinese language is required.

Topic for 2013-14: Twenty-First Century American Literature of Immigration and Diaspora
This course explores the exciting new literature produced by writers transplanted to the United States. We'll consider how the perspectives of recent immigrants redefine what is American by sustaining linkages across national borders, and we'll examine issues of hybrid identity and multiple allegiances, collective memory, traumatic history, nation, home and homeland, and globalization. Our course materials include novels, essays, and films. We'll be looking at writers in the United States with cultural connections to Egypt, Nigeria, Dominican Republic, India, Greece, Vietnam, Bosnia, Ethiopia, Korea, and Mexico. Some authors to be included: André Aciman, Teju Cole, Junot Díaz, Kiran Desai, Lê Thi Diem Thúy, Jeffrey Eugenides, Aleksandar Hemon, Dinaw Mengestu, and Téa Obreht.

Korean American Literature and Culture
Credit Hours
1
Description
What is Korean American Literature and what is the justification for setting it apart from the rest of Asian American literature? The course approaches this question by taking up a range of fictional and dramatic writings, almost all of which were turned out between 1995 and 2012. Many writings not on the syllabus will also be introduced, in order to convey a broader picture. Films on Korean Americans help us look beyond literature per se to a wider cultural perspective. As the semester evolves we will continue to keep an eye on the range of styles, issues, and silences that characterize this field. We will also consider how Korean American literature relates to other literary traditions, such as modern Korean literature and Asian American literature. Finally, we will take up the problem of language: the ways in which English is used to evoke a specifically Korean American idiom and the contrary process through which certain Korean American works reach beyond the “ethnic” designation and into the mainstream. By the end of the semester we will have assembled some tools for deciding whether a piece of literature qualifies as “Korean American.”

Topic for 2013-14: Novels of the Open Road
Novels have a long association with wandering. From Don Quixote onward, characters ride, walk, run, or stumble along roads whose destinations are not always clear. But their reasons for doing so are as varied as their goals. This course examines who moves where and why in novels of the eighteenth century. Are characters seeking adventure or simply survival? Are they running away or toward something? How do gender and class affect one's ability to move? Authors are likely to include Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, Charlotte Smith, and Austen.

We will be studying both the genre of the literary travel essay as well as the more journalistic travel writing found in newspaper travel sections and travel magazines. And, of course, we will be writing our own travel narratives. The course focuses on the essentials of travel writing: evocation of place, a sophisticated appreciation of cultural differences, a considered use of the first person (travel narratives are closely related to the genre of memoir), and basic strong writing/research skills.

Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies

Description
Introduction to the interdisciplinary field of women's and gender studies with an emphasis on an understanding of the "common differences" that both unite and divide women. Beginning with an examination of how womanhood has been represented in myths, ads, and popular culture, the course explores how gender inequalities have been both explained and critiqued. The cultural meaning given to gender as it intersects with race, class, ethnicity, and sexuality will be studied. This course also exposes some of the critiques made by women's studies' scholars of the traditional academic disciplines and the new intellectual terrain currently being mapped.

Women in Love: Portraits of Female Desire in Italian Culture
Credit Hours

Description
This course is dedicated to the representation of female desire in Italian culture. From Dante's Francesca da Rimini to Pasolini's Medea, passing through renowned literary characters such as Goldoni's Mirandolina, Manzoni's Gertrude, and Verdi's Violetta, the course will explore different and contrasting voices of female desire: unrequited and fulfilled, passionate and spiritual, maternal and destructive, domestic and transgressive. In particular, the varied and beautiful voices of women in love will become privileged viewpoints to understand the changes that occur in Italian culture in the conception of desire and other intimate emotions, as well as in the notion of gender and sexuality. Students will read texts by men and women from a wide variety of literary genres and artistic forms including not only prose and poetry, but also theatre, opera, and cinema. They will also read important theoretical essays on the conception of love in Western cultures by Barthes, de Rougemont, Giddens, and Nussbaum.

Topic for 2013-14: A Woman of Independent Means
As with all cultural productions, literary works do not simply reflect reality; they also help to create it. In this course we will read nineteenth- and twentieth-century American literature that endeavors to imagine “a life beyond” traditional social roles for American women. Can a woman write herself (or be written) beyond the confines of slavery, the limitations of the “marriage plot," or the expectations of her cultural inheritance? How has the image of the independent woman in fiction evolved from The Coquette to The Woman Warrior? We will read well-known authors such as Henry James, Emily Dickinson, and Toni Morrison in addition to less canonical writers such as Susan Warner and Hannah Webster Foster. Assignments will include quizzes, a midterm, a final, and a few short response essays.
