Forensic Anthropology with Laboratory
Credit Hours
1
Description
The identification of human remains for criminological and political purposes is widespread. This course explores issues in the identification and interpretation of human bones including methods for determining sex, age, stature, and ancestry as well as for identifying pathologies and anomalies. The course will pay particular attention to those anatomical elements, both soft tissue and bones, that aid in the reconstruction of individuals and their lifestyles. In addition, the course explores search and recovery techniques, crime-scene analysis, the use of DNA in solving crimes, and the role of forensic anthropology in the investigation of mass fatalities from both accidents and human rights violations. It also addresses ballistics and the use of photography in forensic investigation. The course will include a weekly lab component focused on human osteology and skeletal analysis.

Title
Fundamentals of Electricity, Magnetism, and Optics with Laboratory
Credit Hours
1.25
Description
This second semester of classical physics concentrates on the fundamental forces of electricity and magnetism. The electric and magnetic forces are entirely responsible for the structures and interactions of atoms and molecules, the properties of all solids, and the structure and function of biological material. Our technological society is largely dependent on the myriad applications of the physics of electricity and magnetism, e.g., motors and generators, communications systems, and the architecture of computers. After developing quantitative descriptions of electricity and magnetism, we explore the relations between them, leading us to an understanding of light as an electromagnetic phenomenon. The course will consider both ray-optics and wave-optics descriptions of light. Laboratory exercises will emphasize electrical circuits, electronic measuring instruments, optics, and optical experiments.

Topic for 2013-14: Chemistry of the Heavens
Astrochemistry is the study of chemical reactions of atoms, molecules, radicals, and ions in the gas phase and in the condensed phase in interstellar, planetary, and cometary environments. These chemical reactions result in the formation of new molecules ranging from simple diatomics such as molecular hydrogen to complex, prebiotic organic molecules. We will use the tools of chemistry and physics to explore fundamental questions, such as “Are ion-molecule reactions in the gas phase likely to be efficient in the interstellar medium, or do most of these complex organic species form on icy silicate dust grains during warm up, following exposure to low-energy UV light and/or high-energy cosmic radiation such as galactic cosmic rays?”

This course will address fundamental questions about the oceans such as, why do we have oceans and ocean basins? Why do we have ocean currents? How have the interactions among physical, chemical, and biological processes produced the ocean we have today? Why should we strive to learn more about the oceans, and what are the links between the oceans and Earth’s climate? In-class exercises, case studies, and data analysis will emphasize fundamental oceanographic processes and problem solving skills. A mandatory field trip to the coast will allow students to explore coastal processes in action.

Recent earthquake and tsunami events dramatically highlight the vulnerability of human populations and infrastructure to seismic hazards. Only a thorough understanding of the frequency and magnitude of such events will enable local communities to prepare for future disasters. The rapidly evolving field of paleoseismology tries to answer such questions as: Where do earthquakes occur? How large might they be? How frequent are they? In this seminar-style class we will discuss literature to examine primary and secondary earthquake-induced deformation in various geologic archives and under different stress regimes. Through exercises and research projects students will learn techniques to assess the seismic hazard and to prepare threatened communities.

Environmental Limits and Conservation with Laboratory
Credit Hours

Description
The growing use of global resources challenges our ability to conserve resources themselves, as well as species, ecosystems, and environmental quality. This brings up fundamental questions regarding limits to the sustainability of human and natural systems. This course investigates these far-reaching concepts by examining topics such as fundamentals and implications of thermodynamics, energy and material flow through human and natural systems, conservation of resources and biodiversity, and natural resource management. We will also explore the role of science and technology in surmounting previous limits (e.g. energy consumption and agricultural yields), as well as the implications of inherent limits that may never be broken. Laboratory work will focus on quantitative skills and tools used to assess the sustainability of different systems.
