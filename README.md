ScheduleSculptor
================

A tool for students to build possible schedules and receive convenient course recommendations

Have you ever been frustrated trying to build a schedule for next semester? Most likely, the answer is yes. There is no easy to use tool available from Wellesley including Wellesley courses. Luckily, The Schedule Sculptor is here to help!
Please run the file “ScheduleSculptGUI.java” in order to access the Schedule Sculptor.

1.) To get started, browse courses in the Add Course tab. You can search over 100 real Wellesley courses offered in Spring 2014. Search by Department, Distribution, or Time, or any combination of the three. Browse results in the list below. To find out more information about a course, simply select it. If you decide you’d like this course in your schedule, press “Add to Schedule.”

2.) If you get bored of using the Search function, get a little help from the Course Suggestions Panel. Answer questions to find a group of courses tailored to your specifications that won’t conflict with your current schedule. Browse the group of courses using the “Try Again” button, or hit “Start Over” to restart the questions. 

3.) If you get bored of answering questions, there is yet another way to find courses. Hit “Search” next to “Find Random Courses” to find a random course that does not conflict with your schedule, and click on its course name to find out more information and add it to your schedule.

4.) To have a look at your work, head over to the View Schedule tab, which contains a visual representation of your courses. To find out more information about the courses in your schedule, select them from the drop-down box at the bottom.
